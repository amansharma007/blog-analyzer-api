The basic idea for this app is to analyze your competition's blog articles, which will allow you to get an insight into how are they writing their articles and how much are they writing.

The intended features of this app are as follows:
* Count the number of blogs on a website
* Count the total number of words that the blogs are written
* Get the total word count of a blog
* Get the Publishing Frequency of the blog
